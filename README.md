# BelaMiniMoogEmulation
A digital implementation of the Minimoog analog synthesizer with anti-aliased waveforms and a recreation of the moog ladder filter.

The goal of this project was to achieve realistic digital emulation of the 1970s Minimoog analog synthesizer developed by Robert Moog,
with consideration for its analog specificities. 
One of the key features of the emulation is the inclusion of quasi-band-limited waveforms, implemented using the Poly Band Limited Step 
function method proposed by Valimaki (2007).
